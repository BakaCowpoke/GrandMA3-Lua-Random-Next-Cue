# GrandMA3-Lua-Random-Next-Cue
A Lua Plugin that advances to a random cue in a specified Sequence.  
A common Chase feature that seems to have gone by the wayside with the focus shifting towards Phasers.

This repository is just to make it easier to find this pliugin in searches.

This and other Plugins I've been working on are available here:
